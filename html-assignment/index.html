        <h2>About Me</h2> 
        <p>Hello everyone, my name is <em>Daniela Gonzalez,</em> but all my family and friends call me <abbr title="Daniela">Dani</abbr> which is the abbreviation for Daniela. I really like being called Dani, because in my country saying the full name is too formal, or when you meet a person for the first time. My pronouns are she/her, and I am 25 years old.</p>
        <p>I am from <em>Cali, Colombia,</em> and it is known worldwide as the capital of Salsa, a typical dance of my country. In addition, it is a hot city, whose temperature does not vary much throughout the year, since it is a tropical country. So, moving to Canada, which is a cold country with seasons, I consider it as a new adaptation experience.</p>
        <p>I have a degree in <em>Business Administration,</em> at the <em>Icesi University</em> on February 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2021. Because of my young age and being a recent graduate, my work experience is somehow limited. However, I worked as an intern in Brazil as responsible for suppliers and client service, and at a younger age, in Colombia, I started as an entrepreneur selling clothes through a catalogue which was very successful. I decided to apply for Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College, so I can enter the digital media industry to add that competitive advantage, and gain recognition from an international institution.</p>
